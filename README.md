# autocomplete-sofistik

**Support versions of SOFiSTiK are 2022, 2020 and 2018. Only Enligsh.** As the package supports many versions of SOFiSTiK and commands are constantly changing, the package offers hints that may no longer be valid in a given version.

It need to be used with atom package [language-sofistik](https://atom.io/packages/language-sofistik) which provide syntax and gramma settings.
